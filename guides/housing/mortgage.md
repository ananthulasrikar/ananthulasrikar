The annual rate of interest on your CIBC Variable Flex MortgageÂ® is variable. It
will be equal to the CIBC Prime Rate in effect at any given time plus -1.120%.
We will calculate interest daily using a simple interest formula, which is the
same as if it was calculated yearly, not in advance. Interest is calculated by
multiplying the outstanding principal amount by the current mortgage loan
rate in effect at the time. The result is then divided by 365 and then multiplied
by the number of days in the payment period during which that current
mortgage loan rate was in effect. Interest is calculated in this way whether or
not it is a leap year. Interest is payable on each regular payment date.
